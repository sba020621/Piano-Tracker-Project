Compiler: GNU GCC
Date: Started 06/18/2021
Purpose of program: The program reads in a file containing the userâ€™s records
of piano practice (name of piece, composer, and minutes practiced). The program
can sort and display the records by minutes practiced or in alphabetical order by
composer or piece name.
